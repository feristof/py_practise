Practice Repository:
This repository is designed to keep track of my practice with the Python programming language. I will be pushing my various Python codes to this repository in order to keep a record of my progress and development as a Python programmer.

How to use:
Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone <repo-url>.
Open the code files and review the code, make changes and see how it works.
If you want to contribute to this repository, you can create a pull request and I will review it.

Contents:
This repository will contain a variety of Python programs and scripts, including, but not limited to:

Basic programming constructs (e.g. variables, loops, functions, etc.)
Advanced Python concepts (e.g. OOP, decorators, generators, etc.)
Data Structures and Algorithms
Practical projects and challenges

Contributing:
This repository is open to contributions and suggestions. If you have any improvements or additions to the current code, feel free to create a pull request and I will review it.


This readme file should provide a general idea of what the repository is all about, what kind of code you'll find in it, and how you can contribute if you want to.
